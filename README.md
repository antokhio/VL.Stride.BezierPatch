Set of nodes to create bezier surfaces.

The nodes make use of [DX11BezierPatchNode](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv/blob/master/Nodes/VVVV.DX11.Nodes/Nodes/Geometry/Primitives/DX11BezierPatchNode.cs), [BernsteinBasis](https://github.com/mrvux/FeralTic/blob/master/Core/Core/Maths/BernsteinBasis.cs) that come with [dx11-vvvv](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv) by [Julien Vulliet aka mrvux](https://github.com/mrvux)

The library itself is released under [MIT license](https://github.com/antokhio/VL.Stride.BezierPatch/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type
